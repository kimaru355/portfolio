    Hello! Thanks for stopping by my personal website.
</p>
<p>
    I'm Emmanuel Kimaru. I've been working in web development for over 4 years, doing both the coding you see on the screen (frontend) and the stuff that happens behind the scenes (backend). I know how to manage projects using methods like Waterfall and Agile. But what really gets me excited is making websites and apps that are easy for everyone to use and look good too!
</p>
<p>
    I'm really into JavaScript, which is the language I use to build websites. I also know a bunch of frameworks that make building websites even easier, like React, Next.js, Angular, Node.js, Express, and Testing frameworks like Jest, Grafana.k6 and cypress. I have used SQL Server, SQLite, SQL Plus, MySQL and MongoDB but I mostly use Postgresql . I love learning about new web tools and features.
</p>
<p>
    I believe that good communication is super important in any job.
</p>
<p>
    I'm good at adapting to different situations, working efficiently, and always trying to do my best. My experience has taught me how to solve problems and team leadership, although I mostly enjoy working with others to get things done. I'm excited about the chance to work together and make cool stuff!
</p>
<p>
    I'm looking forward to the possibility of working with you!
</p>
